# Chief of Staff to the Founding Team

**About Automate Medical**&#x20;

At Automate Medical we are launching Plaid for healthcare. We raised a $2M pre-seed round in 2021 from some of the world’s best investors, have hit product market fit and are now ready to begin scaling. As a 3 person co-founding team we’ve known each other for 15+ years, have all been through YC or lead YC backed companies, and have cumulatively raised over $20M in our careers so far. We have deep experience building, managing and selling and are now ready to grow our non-technical team.

As our first non technical hire, the Chief of Staff will hit the ground running as a support to the co-founding team and then grow alongside us into an executive role as the team scales.

You’ll also drive results through individual analysis and project management along with tracking and building out metrics and KPIs for cross functional initiatives.
