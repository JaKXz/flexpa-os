## [ðŸ¤”](https://emojipedia.org/thinking-face/) How does hiring work?

When we hire full time employees, we follow this process:

1. You have a phone (voice) call with the CTO - which we advance or decline
2. We ask you to complete one of:
   * An async work sample test
   * A paid short term contract
   * Significant open source community contribution within the last < 12 months
3. You review the work sample on a video call with the CTO
4. We have a "founding team" call together
5. Offer made or declined

We commit to acting promptly in this process and keeping candidates informed.
