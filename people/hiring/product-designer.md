# Product designer

We are building a flexible patient access SDK called Flexpa.

As of July, millions of American patients can now give app developers access to their health plan data. Flexpa is the easiest way to get started. Use cases for Flexpa include instant health plan verification, explanation of benefits checks, and speed of access to health records from patients directly.

* Company formed at start of 2021 by ex-YC founder group of 3
* You will become a founding team member at Flexpa and help us launch our development kit
* You will alter the trajectory of our work, rapidly prototype, and strive to be word-class in your contributions
* We will pay you competitively and give you lots of creative/maker time
* You will gain (or already have) expert level skills in health information systems and protocols

As our founding team product designer, we think you'd be excited to:

* Work on hard problems in a hard space that really matters - everyone has been a patient or will be one
* Develop design solutions to the problems patients face in healthcare
* Be a strong voice for the patient - for communicating how to use new kinds of health identity/authentication to patients, communicating privacy rights and how data is shared
* Complete end to end product design with our software developers and work in a tightly integrated team of professionals
* Deliver a11y-friendly design

We want to work with people who are:

* Authentic and opinionated â€” with a story to tell
* Thinking about the future a lot these days
* An ex-founder or a future founder

Bonus: if you know about healthcare standards or have worked in health before let us know when you apply!
