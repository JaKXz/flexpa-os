# Software developer

We are building a flexible patient access SDK called Flexpa.

As of July, millions of American patients can now give app developers access to their health plan data. Flexpa is the easiest way to get started. Use cases for Flexpa include instant health plan verification, explanation of benefits checks, and speed of access to health records from patients directly.

* Company formed at start of 2021 by ex-YC founder group of 3
* You will become a founding team member Flexpa and help us launch our development kit
* You will alter the trajectory of our work, rapidly prototype, and strive to be word-class in your contributions
* We will pay you competitively and give you lots of creative/maker time
* You will gain (or already have) expert level skills in health information systems and protocols
* You will work on hard problems in a hard space that really matters - everyone has been a patient or will be one
* You will write functional code primarily with TypeScript but with few other hard technical requirements - you will have a unique opportunity to make early technical decisions with the team

We want to work with people who are:

* Authentic and opinionated â€” with a story to tell
* Thinking about the future a lot these days
* An ex-founder or a future founder
* Deeply technical

Bonus: if you know what FHIR, HL7 V2, X12 are, tell us when you apply.
