# üó£ Communication Best Practices

## **Why**&#x20;

Effective communication enables teams to be productive and aligned. When communication is ineffective teams become frustrated and unproductive.

## What

#### Some of the principles we follow at Flexpa are:&#x20;

**We default to asynchronous, written communication before utilizing other synchronous solutions**&#x20;

* When communicating through Slack include your ‚Äúask‚Äù in the initial message
* Use screenshots and/or screencasts to provide context (see[ using the best tool for the job](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gkBcnlk5A9a5PQB1AaFFvMKFKVIHvWJeGEFMuB5\_zvk/edit))
* Prefer bullet point form over long-form paragraphs

**We believe in open and transparent communication**

* Internal department meetings are often open invite&#x20;
* Everyone is encouraged to read and contribute to the monthly investor updates

**Respect the** [**Makers‚Äô vs Managers‚Äô Schedule**](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)&#x20;

* For makers to be productive they need at least two hours of uninterrupted work. Forcing a context switch during those blocks will cost productivity and is often frustrating to the maker.
* When scheduling meetings with a maker aim to have the meeting around naturally occurring context switches (e.g. right before/after lunch)
