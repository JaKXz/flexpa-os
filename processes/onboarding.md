# ðŸ‘‹ Onboarding Guide

## Welcome

We are so excited youâ€™re here and look forward to working together successfully.

This is an onboarding checklist for you to follow (and for the people you're working with to prepare for).

### Getting started

* [ ] Once you accept your offer, let us know your mailing address. Weâ€™ll be sending you your computer the week before your official start date.&#x20;
* [ ] Sign your offer letter & employment agreements&#x20;
* [ ] Confirm receipt of your laptop&#x20;
* [ ] Complete Gusto or Humi registration (Gusto if you are in the US, Humi if you are in Canada)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't be surprised if you encounter a [**spear phishing**](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/phishing/spear-phishing/) attempt during your first few weeks. New employees are an easy target for cybercriminals so be sure to pay close attention to **Vanta's cybersecurity training**. \
\
Mark these emails as **unsafe** & forward them to Josh, our CTO, for further evaluation.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Beyond

Really, anyone who joins a new group successfully goes through an evolution that looks like: becoming knowledgeable, becoming productive, and becoming indispensable - meaning that you would be missed if you left! Everything you do beyond this point should target going through this evolution in your first 3 months.
