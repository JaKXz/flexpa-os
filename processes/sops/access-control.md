# ðŸ›‚ Access control

## Goal

Maintain security and control of internal team tools and to segment access according to role

### Process

{% hint style="info" %}
These apply to the tools we use as a team. These do not describe processes or procedures about customer data.
{% endhint %}

* Google Apps (@flexpa.com) is used for identity management - only full time employees may have access
* When a full-time employee joins, they are granted an @flexpa.com identity that must revoked _immediately_ should employment end for any reason
* Where available, we make use of SSO capabilities from third party vendors to support using our @flexpa.com logins
* Where available, we enable and require 2FA to be used
* Where available, we enable and require password complexity
* When employment ends, all access must be terminated promptly

### Access control requests

During on-boarding and off-boarding a formal access control request must be created on GitHub. This request takes the form of a Github issue on the flexpa/flexpa repository.

The access control request is our log of what access we granted or revoked and when. It is critically important that it is created and processed in a timely manner.
