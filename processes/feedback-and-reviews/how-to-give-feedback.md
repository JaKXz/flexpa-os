# ✍ How to give feedback

## Why

True personal and professional growth comes from receiving feedback. When feedback isn’t surfaced teams become resentful, distrustful, and unproductive.

## **What**&#x20;

Providing _good_ feedback can be hard. There's no one single right way. The most important thing is to find something that works.

One popular method[ Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach/). Radical Candor is achieved when you care personally and challenge directly.

### Some pro-tips

**Praise in public, criticize in private.**&#x20;

* When people receive critical feedback in front of their peers they naturally feel defensive and are less likely to internalize feedback**.**&#x20;
* Ask if the person is open to receiving feedback before sharing your feedback.

**Beware of** [**Ruinous Empathy**](https://www.radicalcandor.com/our-approach/)**.**

* This is often the default quadrant for caring people
* When you withhold feedback for the sake of avoiding an uncomfortable conversation you deprive your peer of long term growth and hinder the rest of the team’s productivity

**Positive feedback is important.**

* An HBR study found that a ratio of \~5 incidences of positive feedback to 1 incidence of negative is optimal if you want to ensure that your negative feedback is fully trusted, listened to and internalized

**Avoid broad statements and be specific (for positive feedback too)**

* e.g. avoid statements like “Your communication needs improving”, instead provide feedback like “During your presentation, your slides had typos on slides 3 and 5. When typos slip through I fear it makes our team appear sloppy.”
* e.g, avoid statements like “That was a great presentation”, instead provide feedback like “I really liked the animation you added on slide 3. I think it perfectly highlights our product’s value and showed that our team pays attention to detail”
  * Broad positive feedback can feel insincere, “they’re just saying that to be nice”

**When giving feedback offer to help or propose a solution.**

* See the example above, where the feedback suggested adding the Grammarly extension as an extra pair of eyes

**Prefer to provide feedback immediately.**

* Often there is lost context if feedback isn’t shared immediately
