# üëã Onboarding guide

## Welcome

We are so excited you‚Äôre here and look forward to working together successfully.

This is an onboarding checklist for you to follow (and for the people you're working with to prepare for).

### Getting started

* [ ] You will receive a legal agreement for your work with us from Thomas via e-mail, signing the offer is your first task
* [ ] We will provide you with a work laptop in advance, please make sure to give Thomas your current address
* [ ] You will receive an e-mail with access to yourname@flexpa.com
* [ ] Setup the email account + setup 2FA

### Day 1

Tools

* [ ] Using your new email account (if you can't access it, ask Josh), use the [self-sign link to join Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/automate-medical/signup)
* [ ] Review the team [software we use](apps.md), sign up for Gitbook and other team tools. If you don't have a GitHub account you will need one.

People

* [ ] Meet the team on Around

Process

* [ ] Review the [Processes](sops/) we have (for things like operational procedures).&#x20;
* [ ] Review our company-wide "[Quest log](https://github.com/orgs/flexpa/projects/1)" (project board) on Github - bookmark this page. See what people are working on here. Check out the #standup room on Slack for a sense of what people have been working on.

HR/Security

* [ ] Thomas will email you documentation about getting paid and other employment requirements to the @flexpa.com address
* [ ] You will receive onboarding instructions to our security platform partner Vanta. You must pay attention to these especially.

### Week 1

Education

* [ ] Watch [James Agnew's Intro to FHIR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbQcJj1GqH0). Knowing some basic domain ideas about healthcare data is important for anyone who joins and you should spend time learning about FHIR and HL7 standards. [Sign up for FHIR Chat](https://chat.fhir.org) - it's the best place to ask questions in this domain to developers.
* [ ] Make a FHIR request for real
* [ ] Read the short (unfinished) book we wrote called [Build in Health the Easy Way](https://docs.sero.run/book/build) **-** this will give you an introduction to some concepts in health tech. Find other materials to follow like [Brendan Keeler's Health API Guy Substack](https://healthapiguy.substack.com).
* [ ] Read our "up to date" pitch for the [Company and what we're building](about.md) and on [automatemedical.com](https://www.automatemedical.com), this will help you understand what we're working on

Product

* [ ] No matter what the Flexpa SDK product is in, you must test it. Follow the basic setup instructions available.

Process

* [ ] Be assigned your first issue on GitHub - most of the "tasks" from here on will take place outside of this onboarding guide.

"Putting the shopping cart back"

* [ ] Can you find any mistakes or errors in this onboarding guide or other content on [handbook.flexpa.com](https://handbook.flexpa.cm)? Did you complete an onboarding task on the first day or in the first week that wasn't mentioned here? Add it!

### Month 1

For devs, you should try to use your first month to bridge skills gaps you may have. Depending on your skill level, this may take longer than a month or not even be necessary at all. You be the judge!
