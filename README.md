# âœŒ Welcome

This is our company handbook. Some of the work we do happens in public. How we operate is part of that.

This handbook was inspired by [Gitlab's handbook-first approach to documentation](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/).

You can find information here about the **company**, groups/**people**, and **day to day operations** or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

This handbook is public because:

> Public handbooks lead to accountability. It's easier to let an internal wiki rot than it is a handbook which is open to the world.
