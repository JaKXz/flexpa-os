# ðŸ—£ Communication

We have two guiding principles in our communication:

1. We like to write things down to remember things and to keep ourselves accountable
2. Communication styles and tools should be adapted to time/manner/purpose

Different roles at Flexpa require different communication skills but everyone is expected to be good at communicating through writing.
