# Founders and history

## Brief history

Flexpa was started as Automate Medical and announced publicly in [March, 2020](https://andrew-arruda.medium.com/hello-world-2f0cb5bd2116). From the start, we believed that most of the upside in healthcare is still in the future. We focussed on an isolated problem to start: the time and cost of interpreting the (very common) pulmonary function test.&#x20;

We traced the recent development of PFT testing standards by the American Thoracic Society and we built two product prototypes:

* ****[**PFT Tutorbot**](https://pfttutorbot.automatemedical.com) was built from the ground up as a "modernization demo" of clinician reporting expectations for pulmonary function tests.
* ****[**PFT Extractor**](https://automatemedical.substack.com/p/pft-extractor) **** was built to solve the data interoperability challenge associated with automatically processing PFTs: the tests are PDFs! PFT Extractor can accept an input PDF and output structured JSON + LOINC coded PFT data.

Our work on these early product prototypes culminated in our publication of a [**FHIR Implementation Guide for Pulmonary Function Tests**](https://automate-medical.github.io/pft-ig/). This publication also led us to refocus on developing better dev tooling for the FHIR community and away from a specific focus on PFTs.

By August of year one, we released [**Sero: a set of modern JavaScript Modules for FHIR**](https://www.github.com/flexpa/sero). Flexpa as a product began to crystallize soon after.&#x20;
