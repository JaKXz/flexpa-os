# ðŸŒ  Mission, vision, and values

The future belongs to those who show up. We're showing up for a future where you can actually own your health data in the way you own the rest of your digital life (_it is_ _yours after all)_.

Every _actually_ _good_ idea isnâ€™t going to sound particularly believable. Part of it being an _actually good_ idea is that itâ€™s uncommonly believed. Most of our sense of believability is based on assumption of stability â€” not where things could change.

Flexpa is dedicated to working on healthcare problems in a future that is messy and complicated and needs to bend to patients and people. We build [dev tools that make launching in digital health easy](https://docs.sero.run) because of the experience we went through trying to launch ourselves.

### Values

* We value honesty and authenticity
* We value building in the open
* We value keeping ourselves up to date and adapting to what we learn, and keeping this handbook, mission, and values updated to reflect reality
