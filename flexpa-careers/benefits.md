# 📖 Benefits

**🩺 Medical, Vision, & Dental**

We’re passionate about making healthcare easily accessible for patients and builders through our product. We believe our employees deserve the same. Flexpa employees and their dependents receive employer-paid medical, vision, and dental benefits, access to FSA & HSA accounts, and employer-sponsored life insurance.&#x20;



**🏠 Working from Home**

Flexpa is a remote-first organization but we acknowledge that everyone’s work styles and productivity vary between environments. Because of this, we’re happy to offer every Flexpa employee a WeWork all-access membership and home office credit.



**💰 Money Matters**&#x20;

Flexpa offers employer-sponsored retirement plans along with a generous employer contribution match for full-time employees. We partner with Guideline for plans in the US and CommonWealth for plans in Canada.



🏖 **PTO**

We offer unlimited paid time off and encourage you to use it. Time-off requests are managed between your manager and should be added to the Flexpa calendar.



For specific details about each plan, refer to the benefits handbooks found in Humi or Gusto.

If you have any questions about benefits, reach out to your manager or Claudio, our Chief of Staff.
