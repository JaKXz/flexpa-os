Flexpa is remote native. When we started working together, we were in different cities.

We are okay with remote work in the United States and Canada because we operate in the EST-PST timezones.

We help our customers verify health plan coverage, benefits, and claims by directly connecting them to the patient's own controlled access to that data. We are building Flexpa for a patient access future we know is coming and we think we're poised to help.

Really big. Our use cases span a bunch of hyper-specific healthcare problems (Medicare brokers, health plan selection, patient bill pay) but also wide-ranging topics beyond that core (clinical trials, virtual care providers, and fintech applications). Given the novel nature, we're finding more all the time!
