# âœ‹ Standups

## Goal

Communicate status/progress and write down our goals for every day.

## Process

Use the #standups channel on Slack.

Every morning by 10AM local time post your standup note (you can do this in advance if you post at the end of the previous day).

A standup note should consist of up to five bullet points:

* How are you feeling out of 10
* What am I focussed on today?
* What am I blocked on? (tag people)
* Notes about availability (i.e "busy from 2pm to 4pm")
* Something you are grateful for today
