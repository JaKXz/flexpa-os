# ðŸ¤” What is Flexpa?

## Dev tools that make launching in digital health easy.

### We build open source dev tools that let devs build products with real health data from real patients. Launch, grow and scale with just a few lines of our code.

As of July 1, \~80M US patients can sign-in with a modern accounts/identity mechanisms (OAuth 2.0) from major health insurance plan administrators. These are new kinds of Health IDs.

With Health IDs, patients can grant apps permission to access a graph (API) of structured healthcare data such as medications, procedures, observations, care plans, coverage, and more.

There are dozens of Health IDs in production and weâ€™re a flexible way for patients to connect to them all.
